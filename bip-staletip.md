## Abstract

Bitcoin miners sporadically produce stale blocks: valid blocks or valid block
headers that do not become part of the node's active chain. This BIP defines an
optional peer-to-peer (P2P) feature for announcing recent stale chain tips to
peers. The announcement includes the stale branch headers and whether the sender
is willing to serve the corresponding tip block data.

## Motivation

Being aware of stale blocks can be useful in ensuring the health of the Bitcoin
network.

The most immediate and practical benefit is that when there is a stale block
with the same cumulative proof of work as the current active tip, there is the
potential for the current active tip to be reorged out in favour of a child of
the stale block. In this case, having the stale branch already downloaded will
make dealing with the reorg faster.

A more long term benefit of tracking stale blocks is that it allows for an
indirect measurement of the efficiency with which miners are able to update to a
new tip. Slower updates to new tips will result in more stale blocks. If block
data is available, it also permits measurement of differences in block creation
policy between mining pools, because the contents of stale blocks tend to show
how similar or different the mining pools' mempools were when the blocks were
found.

These benefits are not essential to the operation of the Bitcoin network, so
this is proposed as an optional feature, with low performance demands and strict
resource limits.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119.

For the purposes of this document, "active chain" means the chain that a node
has selected as its current best chain. A "stale branch" is a sequence of valid
headers that descends from a known block but whose tip is not on the node's
active chain. The "stale tip" is the last header in that branch.

### Protocol Constants

Implementations of this BIP use the following limits unless otherwise noted:

| Name | Value | Meaning |
| ---- | ----- | ------- |
| `MAX_STALETIP_HEADERS` | 20 | Recommended maximum number of `CompressedHeader` entries in one `staletip` message |
| `STALETIP_RECENT_WINDOW` | 1000 blocks | Recommended maximum distance from the receiver's active tip |
| `MAX_RETAINED_STALETIPS` | 10 | Recommended maximum number of stale tips retained for later relay |

`MAX_STALETIP_HEADERS` is a resource-management limit[^rat-maxforklen]. The
value of 20 is intended to cover the short stale branches useful for reorg
detection while avoiding long-term tracking of persistent chain splits.

`STALETIP_RECENT_WINDOW` is a resource-management limit[^rat-maxheight]. The
1000-block window is about seven days and balances limiting resource usage with
allowing stale tips to propagate. `MAX_RETAINED_STALETIPS` is also a
resource-management limit[^rat-denialofservice]. Retaining up to 10 stale tips,
combined with the 20-header branch limit, keeps relaying all known stale tips to
a new peer under 10kB. Implementations MAY use stricter limits and SHOULD NOT
punish peers solely for sending stale tips outside local policy limits.

### Staletip Feature Definition

This BIP defines a new [BIP 434][BIP434] feature id ("the `staletip` feature"):

 * `https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/tree/202601-staletips`

If this specification is assigned a BIP number, the feature id SHOULD be updated
to a BIP-number based identifier as recommended by BIP 434, for example
`BIPxxx` or `BIPxxxv1`.

The `staletip` feature data MUST contain at least one byte. The first byte is a
boolean, `prefers_blocks`, indicating whether the node advertising the feature
prefers to collect the full block data associated with stale tips:

 * `\x00`: the node prefers header-only announcements and does not request that
   announcements be delayed until block data is available.
 * `\x01`: the node prefers announcements that include availability of block
   data where practical.

Nodes receiving an empty `staletip` feature data field, or a first byte other
than `\x00` or `\x01`, MUST ignore that peer's `staletip` feature
advertisement. They SHOULD NOT disconnect solely because the feature data is not
understood.

For future compatibility, nodes SHOULD ignore any additional feature data bytes
after the first byte.

### BIP 434 Negotiation

Nodes implementing this BIP MUST use BIP 434 to negotiate support before
sending any `staletip` messages.

Nodes MUST NOT send a `staletip` message to a peer unless that peer advertised a
valid `staletip` feature during BIP 434 feature negotiation. Nodes SHOULD ignore
`staletip` messages received from peers that did not advertise a valid
`staletip` feature. Nodes MAY disconnect peers that repeatedly send such
messages without negotiation.

Nodes advertising this feature SHOULD send the BIP 434 `feature` message with
the `staletip` feature id and feature data defined above before sending their
`verack` message.

Advertising the feature only signals willingness to receive `staletip` messages.
It does not oblige a node to send them or to serve block data. A node MAY
advertise the feature to receive stale tips while never sending any itself, for
example a node that only collects stale tips for research.

### The `staletip` Message

The `staletip` message is a post-handshake P2P message with the ASCII message
type `staletip` and the following payload:

| Type | Name | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `uint256` | `fork_point` | The block hash used as the previous block hash of the first compressed header |
| vector of `CompressedHeader` | `headers` | The stale branch headers after `fork_point`, ordered from oldest to newest |
| `bool` | `have_block` | Whether the sender is willing to serve block data for the stale tip |

The `fork_point` MUST be known by the receiver and MUST be the predecessor of
the first reconstructed header. In the common case it is the block where the
stale branch diverges from the receiver's active chain. It MAY be a later known
stale-branch header if both peers are expected to already know that header; in
that case the `headers` vector only contains the unknown suffix.

The `headers` vector is serialized as normal: encode the length of the vector as
a 1, 3, 5 or 9 byte `CompactSize`, then encode each member of the vector. Only
minimally-encoded `CompactSize` values are supported.

The `bool` serialization is a single byte `\x00` for false, and a single byte
`\x01` for true. Other encodings are malformed.

The `headers` field is ordered from oldest (the header immediately following
`fork_point`) to newest (the stale tip itself).

`have_block` set to `true` means the sender currently has, and is willing to
serve through normal block download mechanisms, the full block data for the
stale tip, which is the final header in this `staletip` message. `have_block`
set to `false` makes no claim about stale-tip block-data availability. A sender
SHOULD NOT set `have_block` to `true` unless it expects a request for that block
to succeed.

Because stale tips are very rare, this BIP does not reserve a 1-byte [BIP
324][BIP324] message type ID for the `staletip` message.

#### `CompressedHeader` Format

The `CompressedHeader` is a 48 byte structure equivalent to regular block header
serialization, but omits the previous block's hash[^rat-compressedheader]. The
fields are serialized exactly as the corresponding fields are serialized in a
Bitcoin block header:

| Size | Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| 4 | `version` | `int32_t` | Block version information |
| 32 | `merkle_root` | `uint256` | The Merkle root of the block's transactions |
| 4 | `time` | `uint32_t` | The block's timestamp |
| 4 | `bits` | `uint32_t` | The calculated difficulty target being used for this block |
| 4 | `nonce` | `uint32_t` | The nonce used to generate this block |

### Sending `staletip` Messages

Nodes implementing this BIP MAY send `staletip` messages to advertise recent
stale tips they are aware of. If so:

- Nodes SHOULD send `staletip` messages advertising recent stale tips
  that they are aware of to peers that support the `staletip` feature.
- `staletip` messages MUST NOT be sent to peers that have not indicated
  support for the `staletip` feature.
- Nodes SHOULD NOT advertise stale tips that violate header consensus rules
  (invalid version, invalid timestamps, invalid difficulty changes,
  insufficient proof of work).
- Nodes MUST NOT send `staletip` messages if they are not sure that the
  `fork_point` is a block that their peer is aware of. This can be
  estimated by tracking the highest work blocks announced by the peer,
  and assuming the peer is treating that block as its active tip. Provided
  the `fork_point` is an ancestor of that highest work block, the peer
  will be aware of the `fork_point`.
- The `fork_point` SHOULD be chosen to minimise the number of entries
  in the `headers` vector, while still being a block that the peer already
  has header information for.
- Nodes MAY choose a `fork_point` based on their own active chain,
  even if that results in the `headers` vector repeating some headers
  that the peer already knows.
- Nodes SHOULD NOT advertise stale tips whose tip height is more than
  `STALETIP_RECENT_WINDOW` blocks behind the sender's active tip.
- Nodes SHOULD NOT advertise stale branches longer than `MAX_STALETIP_HEADERS`
  headers.
- Nodes SHOULD apply proof-of-work or chainwork thresholds sufficient to avoid
  using this message as a low-cost spam channel[^rat-denialofservice].
- Nodes SHOULD avoid advertising the same tip to the same peer repeatedly via
  multiple `staletip` messages.
- Nodes SHOULD respect the peer's `prefers_blocks` setting. If a peer sets
  `prefers_blocks` to `\x00`, stale tips SHOULD be relayed to that peer
  promptly, without waiting to obtain block data. Conversely, for a peer that
  sets `prefers_blocks` to `\x01`, a node that does attempt to obtain block
  data SHOULD defer sending the `staletip` message to that peer until it has
  obtained the relevant block data, unless doing so would substantially delay
  propagation.
- Nodes that have the block data corresponding to the tip block (and will
  provide that data to peers that request it) SHOULD set `have_block`
  as `true`. Nodes without the full block data, or that are unwilling
  to relay the data to peers, SHOULD set `have_block` as `false`.

### Receiving `staletip` Messages

Nodes implementing this BIP MAY process `staletip` messages from peers to gain
more knowledge about stale tips. If so:

- Nodes SHOULD reject messages whose payload cannot be parsed exactly as a
  `staletip` payload, including non-minimally encoded `CompactSize` values,
  truncated data, invalid boolean values, or trailing bytes. Nodes MAY
  disconnect peers for malformed payloads.
- Nodes SHOULD reject (ignore) `staletip` messages where the `fork_point` is
  not known, and MAY disconnect the sending peer if this occurs. Sending such a
  message violates the requirement above that senders MUST NOT send `staletip`
  messages unless they are sure the receiver knows the `fork_point` block.
- Nodes SHOULD reject messages where the `headers` vector is empty, and MAY
  disconnect the sending peer if this occurs.
- When processing a `staletip` message, nodes MUST bound the resources they
  devote to it so that a denial-of-service vector is not
  created[^rat-denialofservice]. Enforcing the `MAX_STALETIP_HEADERS`,
  `STALETIP_RECENT_WINDOW`, and `MAX_RETAINED_STALETIPS` limits is one way to
  satisfy this requirement; nodes MAY apply stricter limits.
- Nodes MAY ignore messages where the `headers` vector contains more than
  `MAX_STALETIP_HEADERS` entries, or MAY partially process headers until local
  limits are reached.
- Nodes SHOULD ignore messages whose stale tip is not recent according to local
  policy, for example more than `STALETIP_RECENT_WINDOW` blocks behind the
  receiver's active tip.
- Nodes MAY ignore messages that violate local denial-of-service checks, or MAY
  partially process headers until local limits are reached. Nodes SHOULD NOT
  disconnect or otherwise punish peers solely for exceeding local policy limits.
- After receiving a `staletip` message that passes local denial-of-service
  checks, nodes SHOULD reconstruct the block headers from the `CompressedHeader`
  encoding, validate the headers, and add any new valid headers to their block
  database.
- Nodes SHOULD ignore any headers found to be invalid, and SHOULD NOT disconnect
  or otherwise punish peers for relaying invalid headers[^rat-ignoreinvalid].
- If `have_block` is `true`, nodes that prefer to collect the full block data
  SHOULD request that data in the normal way, for example by sending a `getdata`
  message for the reconstructed stale tip block hash.
- Nodes that receive a new stale tip SHOULD announce that tip to their peers
  that negotiated the `staletip` feature, subject to local relay policy.

Nodes in initial block download SHOULD NOT announce stale tips, and MAY ignore
received `staletip` messages, until they are close enough to the active network
tip for stale-tip recency checks to be meaningful.

If a received `staletip` branch has more cumulative proof of work than the
receiver's current active chain, the receiver SHOULD process the reconstructed
headers through its normal header-processing logic. Such a branch may cease to
be stale from the receiver's perspective.

#### Active Tip Announcements

In order for peers to send useful `staletip` messages, they must be able to
track which block is your active tip in order to deduce whether you already know
the fork point corresponding to new stale tips.

Currently, many node implementations make a small optimisation in their block
announcement handling that conflicts with this requirement: they will not
announce a block to a peer if they have already processed an announcement for
the same block from that peer at the time they validate the block. That said,
due to delays in obtaining block data and validating the block, it is usually
the case that two well-connected peers will announce the same new block to each
other.

Nodes implementing this BIP SHOULD always announce their new active tip to all
peers. To minimise additional bandwidth, they MAY do so via an `inv` message
rather than a `headers` or compact block message.

#### Reconstructing Headers

Headers may be reconstructed from a `staletip` message via the following
algorithm:

```
    std::vector<CBlockHeader> headers;
    uint256 prev_hash = staletip_msg.fork_point;
    for (const auto& ch : staletip_msg.headers) {
        headers.emplace_back({
            .nVersion = ch.version,
            .hashPrevBlock = prev_hash,
            .hashMerkleRoot = ch.merkle_root,
            .nTime = ch.time,
            .nBits = ch.bits,
            .nNonce = ch.nonce,
        });
        prev_hash = headers.back().GetHash();
    }
```

Note that headers are reconstructed in order, from oldest (closest to the
`fork_point`) to newest (the stale tip itself).

### Optionality

Node software implementing this BIP SHOULD provide a configuration option to
disable it entirely. Implementations MAY provide separate options for relaying
stale headers and for requesting or serving stale block data.

### Test Networks

Making this feature available on test networks raises additional concerns,
as they are less protected by proof of work, and thus may have a larger
attack surface for denial of service issues. As a result, node software
implementing this BIP may choose to do so only for mainnet.

#### Signet

The signet network is designed around the assumption that all valid
blocks are signed, and thus much lower proof of work is needed. However,
because the block signatures are included in the coinbase transaction,
it cannot be verified if only the block's headers are available. As such,
when implementing this BIP for signet:

 * Nodes MUST NOT send `staletip` messages when they do not have the
   corresponding block.
 * Nodes MAY disconnect peers that send a `staletip` message with
   `have_block` set to `false`.
 * Nodes SHOULD set `prefers_blocks` to true when negotiating the feature,
   as they will always need to download the full block for a stale tip
   to validate the signature.

In addition, when the difficulty is low, it is possible that varying the
`nBits` field of a valid block will generate another valid block (see
[#33266][#33266]). As such,

 * Nodes SHOULD consider variant headers (where the previous block and
   merkle root are both the same) to be duplicates, and only advertise
   the first seen variant as a stale tip.

While nodes MAY also deduplicate such variant headers when receiving them
via `staletip` messages, if they do not perform the same deduplication
logic when receiving such headers via standard `headers` or `block`
relay, that provides little protection. Deduplicating when sending `staletip`
messages is primarily aimed at avoiding nodes implementing this BIP from
being used to amplify attacks.

Only variant tips need to be deduplicated: it is possible (though
unlikely) that valid, signed blocks may be descendants of variant
blocks. These blocks will not themselves be variants, as they will have
different previous blocks.

#### Testnet3, Testnet4

While testnet3 and testnet4 blocks are proof of work based like mainnet,
they both allow for low difficulty blocks:

 - testnet3 allows minimum difficulty blocks when a block's timestamp
   is 20 minutes after the previous block's timestamp, and resets the
   difficulty on an ongoing basis if this occurs for the last block in
   a retarget period.
 - testnet4 updates these rules (as specified in [BIP 94][BIP94]), basing
   the difficulty calculation for the first block in a new retarget period
   on the difficulty of the first block in the previous retarget period,
   rather than the previous block, avoiding a reset.

As a result, nodes could see many valid stale tips with minimum difficulty,
either due to such tips being created with long timestamps, or, on testnet3,
because the difficulty has been reset. To avoid this scenario, when
implementing this BIP on testnet3 or testnet4:

 * Nodes SHOULD only advertise stale tips when the stale tip itself has
   a difficulty greater than the minimum difficulty.
 * Nodes MAY advertise stale tips only when the stale tip itself has
   a difficulty greater than some higher threshold (eg 1,000,000).

## Backward Compatibility

This BIP introduces a new P2P message (`staletip`) and relies on [BIP 434][BIP434]
for feature negotiation to avoid impacting nodes that do not support this BIP.
Nodes MUST NOT send `staletip` messages to peers that have not negotiated the
`staletip` feature.

Nodes that do not support this BIP may still see more frequent notifications of
when their peers update to a new active tip, if implementations choose to make
active-tip `inv` announcements to all peers rather than only to peers that
negotiated the `staletip` feature.

## Privacy Impact

Sharing stale tips raises several potential privacy concerns.

The first concern is fingerprinting. A node's behaviour when negotiating and
sharing stale tips may make it easier for peers to distinguish that node from
others on the network, perhaps allowing attackers to relate a node's onion
address with its IPv4 address. The BIP 434 feature advertisement itself, the
`prefers_blocks` value, active-tip announcement behaviour, and stale-tip relay
timing are all potentially fingerprintable. Since stale tips are expected to
propagate fairly efficiently and consistently, and to remain rare, this is not
expected to be a significant problem in practice. For users that remain
concerned, disabling stale tip relay entirely is probably the best approach.

The second concern is for miners with private transaction pools. In that case,
miners have a selection of transactions that they wish to mine themselves
without giving other miners the opportunity to compete with them, only
publishing them when they construct a block with valid proof-of-work that
includes them. Relaying those transactions via `staletip` announcements will
largely be harmful to a private transaction pool operator, as it will not help
them win the stale block race. It will only allow nodes to reorg slightly faster
if they do win, but if they lose the stale block race it will make their private
transactions available to competing miners. This is a particular concern if the
reason for the block being stale is due to inefficiencies in updating ASIC
miners to a new work target, in which case there is almost no chance of winning
the stale block race. As such, miners operating private transaction pools should
probably disable stale tip relay entirely on the nodes they use for processing
their mined blocks.

## Reference Implementation

A prototype implementation is available at:

 * Bitcoin Core branch: https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/tree/202601-staletips

At the time of this draft, the prototype is work in progress and may lag this
specification. The specification above should be treated as authoritative for
review purposes.

### BCH Fork Headers (18 blocks)

This test vector uses mainnet headers from the BCH fork. Blocks 478559-478576
have valid Bitcoin headers (meeting proof-of-work requirements), but are
invalid Bitcoin blocks (block 478559 exceeds the 1MB block size limit).
Block 478577 changed difficulty under BCH's Emergency Difficulty Adjustment
rules, making it an invalid Bitcoin header as well.

[^rat-compressedheader]: Omitting the previous block hash from each header
    saves 32 bytes per header (40%), as this field can be reconstructed
    from the preceding headers in the message. This does not apply to
    the first header, of course, which is why the fork point must be
    included explicitly. We avoid attempting to omit `nBits` or compress
    `nTime` or `nVersion`, as reconstructing them is significantly more
    complicated, for comparatively much less potential gain.

[^rat-maxheight]: A window of 1000 blocks (about 7 days) provides a
    reasonable balance between limiting resource usage, and maximising
    propagation potential. By limiting the distance to the tip to being no
    older than the previous retarget period, we ensure that the difficulty
    of creating a stale block is comparable to creating a new tip, making
    it uneconomical to use this as a spamming mechanism. By choosing
    a longer period, we provide the opportunity for nodes interested in
    stale block data for research purposes plenty of opportunity to obtain
    the data. In particular, many nodes will tend to discover it through
    the periodic blocks-only connections (see Bitcoin Core PR [#19858]).

[^rat-maxforklen]: Limiting the branch length to 20 headers avoids nodes
    being burdened with tracking deliberate chain splits. When
    incompatible consensus rules are enforced, the majority chain need not
    continue sharing the minority's fork beyond a short window. Twenty
    blocks is sufficient to capture the short-term stale blocks useful
    for reorg detection, while avoiding long-term tracking of persistent
    chain splits.

[^rat-denialofservice]: Limiting stale branches to 20 headers bounds the
    per-message size to under 1kB. Combining this with a default limit of 10
    tracked stale tips ensures that total bandwidth when relaying all known
    stale tips to a new peer is under 10kB. Restricting relay to recent tips
    whose proof of work is comparable to the active chain makes stale-tip spam
    costly on mainnet.

[^rat-ignoreinvalid]: Ignoring rather than punishing allows nodes to apply
    different limits for what stale tips they accept. If one node
    uses stricter limits than its peers, this avoids the risk that
    honest announcements from those peers will cause disconnection and
    potentially network partitions.  This is also consistent with how
    invalid headers are handled.
